                Sir Muhammad Iqbal Kt (Urdu: محمد اقبال; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938), was a South Asian Muslim
                writer,[1][2] philosopher,[3] Scholar and politician,[4] whose poetry in the Urdu language is considered
                among the greatest of the twentieth century,[5][6][7][8] and whose vision of a cultural and political
                ideal
                for the Muslims of British-ruled India[9] was to animate the impulse for Pakistan.[1][10] He is commonly
                referred to by the honorific Allama[11] (from Persian: علامہ, romanized: ʿallāma, lit. 'very knowing,
                most
                learned').[12]

                Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab in an ethnic Kashmiri Muslim family, Iqbal completed his B.A. and
                M.A. at
                the Government College Lahore. He taught Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore from 1899 until 1903.
                During
                this time, he wrote prolifically. Among the Urdu poems from this time that remain popular are Parinde ki
                faryad (A bird's prayer), an early meditation on animal rights, and Tarana-e-Hindi (The Song of
                Hindustan) a
                patriotic poem—both poems composed for children. In 1905, he left for further studies in Europe, first
                to
                England, where he completed a second B.A. at Trinity College, Cambridge and was subsequently called to
                the
                bar at Lincoln's Inn, and then to Germany, where he received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of
                Munich. After returning to Lahore in 1908, he established a law practice but concentrated on writing
                scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is best known for his
                poetic
                works, including Asrar-e-Khudi – after whose publication he was awarded a knighthood,[13]
                Rumuz-e-Bekhudi,
                and the Bang-e-Dara. In Iran, where he is known as Iqbāl-e Lāhorī (Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly
                regarded
                for his Persian works.

                Iqbal regarded Rumi as his Guide and Ashraf Ali Thanwi as the greatest living authority on the matter of
                Rumi's teachings.[14][15] He was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic
                civilisation across the world, but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to
                this
                effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. Iqbal was elected to the
                Punjab
                Legislative Council in 1927 and held a number of positions in the All India Muslim League. In his 1930
                presidential address at the League's annual meeting in Allahabad, he formulated a political framework
                for
                Muslims in British-ruled India.[9] Iqbal died in 1938. After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he was
                named
                the national poet there. He is also known as the "Hakeem-ul-Ummat" (“The Sage of the Ummah”) and the
                "Mufakkir-e-Pakistan" (“The Thinker of Pakistan”). The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e Welādat-e
                Muḥammad
                Iqbāl), 9 November, used to be a public holiday in Pakistan until 2018.[16] Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi
                wrote Glory of Iqbal to introduce him to the Arab world.[17][18]
